# connect-globe
this is my first normal project
In this project only servlets are used 
to start this project firstly copy/paste the 'connect-globe' folder 
into the webapps folder of tomcat server folder
then start the server and run chrome and type the url : 
'http://localhost:8080/connect-globe' and hit enter.
